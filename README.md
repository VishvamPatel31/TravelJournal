## 📚 What I Learned

### 🔹 Core React Skills
- **JSX:** Built structured UI using HTML-like syntax inside JavaScript.
- **Components:** Broke UI into small, reusable parts for cleaner and modular code.
- **Props:** Passed data into components to keep them dynamic and flexible.
- **useState (optional):** If used in your project — tracked and updated component state.
- **Mapping over arrays:** Rendered components dynamically from data arrays.

### 🧠 Other Concepts
- **Single Page App (SPA):** Structured everything within one main `App` component.
- **File-based structure:** Organized components into separate files for readability.
